# Doubly_Linkedlist
Program to perform following functions:

1. To insert an element at specific location in doubly linked list.
2. To delete last element from the doubly linked list.
3. Given a doubly linked list of any number of nodes, write a function ExtremeSwap , which will swap values of the node at extreme pairs.
For e.g., if the node values of a doubly linked list are:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
After first call, values will be
8 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
After second call, values will be
8 7 3 4 5 6 2 1
And finally function will stop after fourth call, and the values will be
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
